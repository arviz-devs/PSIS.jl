As k approaches the upper bound, IS becomes less reliable, while PSIS still works well but with a higher RMSE.\nif frac12  k  07, then the variance is infinite, and IS can behave quite poorly. However, PSIS works well in this regime.\nif 07  k  1, then it quickly becomes impractical to collect enough importance weights to reliably compute estimates, and importance sampling is not recommended.\nif k  1, then neither the variance nor the mean of the raw importance ratios exists. The convergence rate is close to zero, and bias can be large with practical sample sizes.\n\nA warning is raised if k  07.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#PSIS.psis!","page":"Home","title":"PSIS.psis!","text":"psis!(args...; kwargs...)\n\nIn-place compute Pareto smoothed importance sampling (PSIS) log weights.\n\nSee psis for an out-of-place version and for description of arguments and return values.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#PSIS.quantile-Tuple{PSIS.GeneralizedPareto, Any}","page":"Home","title":"PSIS.quantile","text":"quantile(d::GeneralizedPareto, p)\n\nCompute the p-quantile of the generalized Pareto distribution d.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"}]
